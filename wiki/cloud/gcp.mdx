# GCP

What I’ve touched...

- Vision API
- Cloud Run
- Artifact Registry
- Kubernetes Engine

## Vision API

I have pretty limited experience with GCP. In my time at Capsule (around Winter 2020), I
built a proof of concept for insurance card image text extraction. I used the Vision API
in conjunction with Cloud Functions V1 to make a serverless API endpoint that would return
JSON data of extracted text. I only ran minimal model training on a small dataset of images,
and that was quite expensive and **highly manual** (I had to use the web UI and manually drag
boxes around specific insurance card fields). I never got around to implementing the association
of text to insurance fields, like "bin number" and "group number", **and** the project was eventually
derailed by internal misalignment — basically it was cut short, but was certainly fun while
it lasted.

## Kubernetes Engine

I’m currently running a [Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/) server and runner on
an _Autopilot_ Kubernetes cluster, hosted on Kubernetes Engine. It costs about $30/month.

## Cloud Run

I only recently (July 2022) came across Cloud Run. It’s basically _Docker containers on
Lambda_. Here's a Deno `fresh` instance running on Cloud Run:
