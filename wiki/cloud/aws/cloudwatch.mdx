## Log Groups & Log Streams

Each Lambda function will have a Log Group

If you have a Lambda function named `my-function`, the log group will look like
`/aws/lambda/my-function`. If the lambda is deployed to `Lambda@Edge`, the log group
will look like `/aws/lambda/<REGION>.<FUNCTION_NAME>`.

| Kind        | Format                                 | Example                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Regular     | `/aws/lambda/<FUNCTION_NAME>`          | `/aws/lambda/my-function`           |
| Lambda@Edge | `/aws/lambda/<REGION>.<FUNCTION_NAME>` | `/aws/lambda/us-east-1.my-function` |

### Log Streams

Each log group will have multiple log streams.

| Format                              | Example                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `YYYY/MM/DD/[<VERSION>]<guid>` [^1] | `2021/11/19/[$LATEST]edc7a5a6e16c4b83bd1da40a33bc706e` |

[^1]:
    The `<VERSION>` is the version of the Lambda function.
    This could numeric values like `1`,`2`...`139` or `$LATEST`.

# Logs Insights

## `p99`, `p95`, `p67`, `p50`,

> **Note**: `p99` is your _99th percentile_ or top 1% of your user group or data pool.

The following CloudWatch query can be visualized as a line, and will depict function
duration (or latency) as the `p99/95/67/50` for every 10 minutes.

- `p50` is your average case; 50% of function invocations
- `p99` is your worst case; 1% of function invocations

```sql showLineNumbers filename="/aws/lambda/us-east-1.my-lambda-function"
fields @timestamp, @duration as d
    | filter ispresent(d)
    | sort @timestamp desc
    | stats max(d) as max_MS,
      percentile(d, 99) as p99,
      percentile(d, 95) as p95,
      percentile(d, 67) as p67,
      percentile(d, 50) as p50 by bin(10m)
    | limit 10000
```

## Memory Usage

> **Note**: See [**Queries for Lambda logs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax-examples.html)

```sql showLineNumbers
fields @timestamp, @message
    | sort @timestamp desc
    | limit 50
    | filter @type = "REPORT"
    | stats max(@memorySize / 1000 / 1000) as PROVISIONED_MB,
      min(@maxMemoryUsed / 1000 / 1000) as MIN_MB,
      avg(@maxMemoryUsed / 1000 / 1000) as AVG_MB,
      max(@maxMemoryUsed / 1000 / 1000) as MAX_MB,
      MAX_MB / PROVISIONED_MB * 100 as PERCENT_MAX
```
