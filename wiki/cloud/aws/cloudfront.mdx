## Caching GitHub API Responses

On this wiki itself, I leverage remote content from https://github.com/thiskevinwang/public-docs
(checkout the `manifestless` branch).

To construct the lefthand navigation sidebar, I leverage the structure of the filesystem from
https://github.com/thiskevinwang/public-docs. But because this is a separate repository,
I call the GitHub API to get that data.

`GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/trees/:tree_sha?recursive=0` gives me back a JSON blob like the following,
and while not depicted, it contains everything under the `wiki` directory which is what I ultimately want.

```json
{
    "sha": "ce8d144a8c1425dcdb39b8e1f3bf4dc2838cf2d0",
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/trees/ce8d144a8c1425dcdb39b8e1f3bf4dc2838cf2d0",
    "tree": [
        {
            "path": ".gitignore",
            "mode": "100644",
            "type": "blob",
            "sha": "1a1d7b3f64a295cce370b01937cd3af1efa56182",
            "size": 34,
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/blobs/1a1d7b3f64a295cce370b01937cd3af1efa56182"
        },
        {
            "path": "scripts",
            "mode": "040000",
            "type": "tree",
            "sha": "4217754238e0ad8f46bc39d7ebd8fc0057006281",
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/trees/4217754238e0ad8f46bc39d7ebd8fc0057006281"
        },
    ]
    "truncated": false
}        
```

Take note of the `sha` field. I use that later in blob requests.

This is *1* API call. Unfortunately it doesnâ€™t provide _pretty_ text like titles or descriptions. 
It only returns paths which I use as website slugs. The various MDX files have frontmatter with
`name` and `description` keys which are pleasing to the human eye.

I can go fire off **N+1** or **1+N** requests to `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/blobs/:file_sha`,
passing in the `sha` from earlier to fetch individual files' string contents.

> **Note**: I need to set `{"Accept": "application/vnd.github.raw"}` header to fetch the raw string contents.

This way I have access to MDX frontmatter and can attach pretty titles to my previously ugly
tree JSON data.

However, with 50-100's of files, this quickly burns through the `5000` request per... I think it resets every hour?...
rate limit that GitHub sets.

So for this class of requests that are conveniently unique via `:file_sha`, I can set up a 
CloudFront proxy to cache each of these items, which I know will be quite stable, for 1 year.

This significantly cuts down on my GitHub API consumption at page build time, whether that is
at static build time or at on-demand generation time. The math is roughly `M * 1 * N`, where:
- `M`: number of actual pages under `/wiki/[[...slug]]`
- `1`: is the single call to `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/trees/:tree_sha?recursive=0`
- `N`: is multiple calls to `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/blobs/:file_sha`
  - (All of these `N` requests now go to CloudFront)


### CloudFront Settings

For the CloudFront proxy, the notable settings I set are:

- Use Legacy cache settings
- Include `Accept` and `Authorization` headers to be part of the cache key
- Set custom cache TTLs (seconds)
  - Minimum: `31536000` 
  - Maximum: `31536000`
  - Default: `31536000`

That's it. And it's ready in about 3 minutes.

The uniqueness of the GitHub API endpoint, `/repos/:owner/:repo/git/blobs/:file_sha`, lends it 
self nicely to a almost-zero-config CloudFront setup.

### Rate-limit sanity check

Here's Postman Test script for handy rate-limit observability when making
GitHub API calls. I know there's a dedicated `/rate_limit` endpoint, but 
I prefer not calling that simply to avoid tabbing back and forth within Postman.

```js
function msToTime(duration) {
  var milliseconds = Math.floor((duration % 1000) / 100),
    seconds = Math.floor((duration / 1000) % 60),
    minutes = Math.floor((duration / (1000 * 60)) % 60),
    hours = Math.floor((duration / (1000 * 60 * 60)) % 24);

  hours = (hours < 10) ? "0" + hours : hours;
  minutes = (minutes < 10) ? "0" + minutes : minutes;
  seconds = (seconds < 10) ? "0" + seconds : seconds;

  return hours + "h " + minutes + "m " + seconds + "s " + milliseconds + "ms";
}

pm.test("Log rate limit details", function () {
    console.log("Rate-limit remaining", pm.response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Remaining"))
    const resetS = pm.response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Reset")
    const nowMs = new Date().getTime()
    const diff = (resetS * 1000) - nowMs
    console.log("Reset in:", msToTime(diff))
});
// GET https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/trees/manifestless?recursive=0
// Rate-limit remaining 2219
// Reset in: 00h 16m 59s 4ms
```
