I spent unecessarily long trying to get an express.js app to send OpenTelemetry traces to Jaeger.
There are so many different libraries, and either dated or experimental code samples out there
that it feels like there is no exemplary example to follow.

After an hour and half, I finally connected a few disparate dots and got it working.

## Run Jaeger

Run Jaeger locally using the [all-in-one](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.49/getting-started/#all-in-one) Docker image.

```bash filename="Terminal" showlinenumbers
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 6831:6831 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.49
```


| Port | Protocol | Component | Function |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 16686 | HTTP | query | serve frontend |
| 4317 | HTTP | collector | accept OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over gRPC |
| 4318 | HTTP | collector | accept OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over HTTP |

- `http://localhost:16686` is the Jaeger UI
- `4318` is the port that my Express app will send traces to. 

<Note type="warning" fill>
  **Send traces to `/v1/traces`**

  This took me a while to figure out, but I finally found the documented endpoint here: 
  [OTLP Specification 1.0.0 - #OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp-request)

## Instrument the app

The filename is arbitrary, but it's important to note this file has side effects,
and that either a `app.ts` or `server.ts` _entrypoint_ file will import this like so: 
`import "@/tracing.ts"`.

This following code snippet is a combination of the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/README.md
and swapping out the `ConsoleSpanExporter` for the `OTLPTraceExporter`, documented at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http.

```typescript filename="tracing.ts" showlinenumbers
import process from "process";
import * as opentelemetry from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";
import { ConsoleSpanExporter } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";
import { Resource } from "@opentelemetry/resources";
import { SemanticResourceAttributes } from "@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions";

// configure the SDK to export telemetry data to the console
const consoleTraceExporter = new ConsoleSpanExporter(); // unused but you can hot-swap with otlpExporter

const otlpExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
  // https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.49/deployment/#collector
  url: "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
});
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  resource: new Resource({
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: "my-service",
  }),
  traceExporter: otlpExporter,
  instrumentations: [
    getNodeAutoInstrumentations({
      "@opentelemetry/instrumentation-express": { enabled: true },
      "@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http": { enabled: true },
    }),
  ],
});

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk.start();

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on("SIGTERM", () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log("Tracing terminated"))
    .catch((error) => console.log("Error terminating tracing", error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0));
});
```

## Verify traces

Run the app via `npm`, make some requests, and then check the Jaeger UI 
for traces for `my-service`.

The networking between the host machine and Docker should pose no issues.
