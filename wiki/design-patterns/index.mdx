I don’t have a traditional background in computer science, so I missed
out on a lot of the foundational theory that is taught in school. 3+ years
into my career, and I’m still learning a ton and playing catch up.

# Why?

Someone before me likely encountered most of the problems that
I’ve faced thus far, and has architectured solutions for them,
or created a set of principles to help guide any future
developers in the same problem space.

- RESTful APIs are a good example of this.
- [Model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) is another.

## Some topics

- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Service oriented architecture
- Testing
- At least once delivery
- Tightly vs Loosely coupled
- Single point of failure
- Fault tolerance
- Idempotency
- Distributed systems
  - Consensus
- Eventual consistency
- Event sourcing
- Logging
