# Overview

For this site, I author everything in MDX. Diagrams are written as regular
fenced codeblocks, with `mermaid` as the language.

````markdown
```mermaid
%% A basic example
graph LR
  A --> B
```
````

The code blocks are rendered as is, and a **client-side request** is made
to `mermaid.thekevinwang.com` with the diagram payload.

The server returns a SVG image:

```mermaid
%% A basic example
graph LR
    A --> B
```

## Implementation

Behind this, there is a Lambda function, running a Docker container. Here is
an overview of the Dockerfile.

```mermaid
%% Dockerfile
stateDiagram-v2
    Dockerfile --> NODE_DEPS
    Dockerfile --> GO_BUILDER
    NODE_DEPS --> RUNNER : node_modules
    GO_BUILDER --> RUNNER : binary executable

    note left of NODE_DEPS
        This contains the Mermaid CLI node binary
    end note
    state NODE_DEPS {
        [*] --> copy_node_files : ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1
        copy_node_files --> npm_install
        npm_install --> [*]
    }

    note left of GO_BUILDER
        This is a basic http server
    end note
    state GO_BUILDER {
        [*] --> copy_go_files
        copy_go_files --> go_build
        go_build --> [*]
    }

    state RUNNER {
        [*] --> apk_add_chromium:  ENV PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
        apk_add_chromium --> copy_puppeteer_config
        copy_puppeteer_config --> copy_node_deps
        copy_node_deps --> copy_go_executable
        copy_go_executable --> copy_lambda_adapter_extension
        copy_lambda_adapter_extension --> CMD
    }
```

This builds an OCI image, which is hosted on AWS ECR. When Lambda uses this
to run a container, it internally runs a compiled http server, and uses the
Mermaid CLI binary to process incoming diagram text. It returns a simple SVG
string.

The end to end flow looks like this

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CL as Client
    participant CF as CloudFront
    participant AGW as API Gateway
    participant LM as Lambda

    CL->>CF: GET
    activate CF
    alt Cache Hit
        CF->>CL: Cached Response
    else Cache Miss
        CF->>+AGW: Origin Request
        AGW->>+LM: Proxy Integration
        Note over LM: Run Container via ECR image
        LM->>-AGW: (Content-Type: text/plain)
        AGW->>-CF: Origin Response
        CF->>CL: (Content-Type: image/svg+xml)
    end
    deactivate CF
```

## Rationale

The same client-side request to generate a mermaid diagram could occur
server-side, but I simply have it client-side because I want to be
able to request an updated diagram SVG, in response to changes in the
clientâ€™s `mode` value (dark/default).

### `Content-Type`

Iâ€™ve run into some issues with the `Content-Type` header. If I set it
to the _correct_ value â€” `image/svg+xml` â€” in Lambda container code,
it either gets automatically base64-encoded by API Gateway, or I get
an XML error.

```markdown
This page contains the following errors:
error on line 1 at column 1: Document is empty
Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.
```

However, if I call the lambda function's URL directly, it _just works_,
but I donâ€™t get any flexiblity of CDN edge caching, or adding
a fully qualified domain name.

So, my fix was to use edge compute (CloudFront functions) to
modify the `Content-Type` header accordingly. ðŸ§

Here are some syntax cheatsheets I found to be helpful:

- [General](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mermaid-cheat-sheet/) (doesnâ€™t have state diagram snippets though)
- [One with `stateDiagram`](https://coda.io/@leandro-zubrezki/diagrams-and-visualizations-using-mermaid/state-diagram-6)

And of course, the Mermaid live playground
