# What is this?

This is a personal notes scratch pad, inspired by https://wiki.nikiv.dev/. This 
is intended to be a public space where I go and drop unformed ideas and jot down
random notes that may or may not be useful in the future.

I used to be fairly diligent about note-taking in Notion, but lately Iâ€™ve fallen off that
habit and also felt that there are too many additional distractions in Notion.

## Random questions

- Why is response streaming extra important with AI completions?
  - For UX. Completions are often very slow and potentially large as well. If you were to
    buffer the entire response before sending it to the client, the user would have to wait
    quite a while before seeing a meaninful response. With streaming, the user can see a 
    partial response immediately and the rest of the response can be streamed in as it 
    becomes available.
