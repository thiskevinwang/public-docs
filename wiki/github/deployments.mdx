Every `gh` CLI command below will rely on a few variables being set. Additionally,
every command has a `curl` alternative. In my opinion, the `curl` alternative
is a lot more cumbersome as you need to pass an `Authorization` header each time.

```bash
OWNER=thiskevinwang
REPO=workflows-test
```

# List deployments

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments#list-deployments

```bash
gh api /repos/$OWNER/$REPO/deployments
```

# Create a Deployment

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments#create-a-deployment

```bash
res=$(gh api \
  --method POST \
  /repos/$OWNER/$REPO/deployments \
  -f ref='topic' \
  -f payload='{ "deploy": "migrate" }' \
  -f description='Deploy request from hubot')
echo $? # 0 if success
        # 1 if failure
echo $res
```

## Failures

### If the `ref` doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "message": "No ref found for: topic-branch",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-deployment"
}
```

### If any commit status checks failed...

```json
{
  "message": "Conflict: Commit status checks failed for main.",
  "errors": [
    {
      "contexts": [
        {
          "context": "print_progress",
          "state": "failure"
        },
        {
          "context": "PR ${{ github.event.number }} was merged",
          "state": "skipped"
        }
      ],
      "resource": "Deployment",
      "field": "required_contexts",
      "code": "invalid"
    }
  ],
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-deployment"
}
```

#### Resolving

```bash
git commit -m "[skip ci] empty commit with no status checks" --allow-empty
```

## Success

# Deployment Statuses

## List deployment statuses

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/statuses

```bash
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(echo $res | jq -r '.id')
echo $DEPLOYMENT_ID

gh api /repos/$OWNER/$REPO/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID/statuses
```

> **Note**: This will likely be empty until a deployment status has been created.

## Create a deployment status

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/statuses#create-a-deployment-status

```bash
ENV=foobar
STATE=success

gh api \
  --method POST \
  /repos/$OWNER/$REPO/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID/statuses \
  -f environment=$ENV \
  -f state=$STATE \
  -f description='Deployment finished successfully.' \
  -f log_url='https://thekevinwang.com/wiki/overview' \'
```

1 deployment's environment can be flipped to _whatever_.

Youâ€™ll get an audit log of changes at when you [list deployment statuses](#list-deployment-statuses)

---

`state` can be one of: `error`, `failure`, `inactive`, `in_progress`, `queued`, `pending`, `success`
The state of the status. When you set a transient deployment to inactive, the deployment will be shown as destroyed in GitHub.

---

When creating a `success` state, you'll see an entry like

> `f7a9870` was [deployed](#) by <Avatar size={22} src="/image/kevin.webp"/> [**thiskevinwang**](#) 2 hours ago <Badge style={{color:"#3fb950",background:"transparent",borderColor:"#3fb950"}}>Active</Badge>

- `deployed`: the value that was passed into `log_url`. If no `log_url` was passed, the UI will not
  render a link.

# Use cases?

With GitHub actions

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#deployment

```yml
on: deployment
```

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#deployment_status

```yml
on: deployment_status
```

You could run a GitHub action when a 3rd party platform like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku
