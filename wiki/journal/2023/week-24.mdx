# Monday

# Tuesday

Took point and was successful on ensuring HCP Vault Secrets content was successfully deployed to developer.hashicorp.com on June 13th, 2023 at 9am BST. 

- See: https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets

Challenges:

- highly cross functional
- no clear owner
- business critical
- time sensitive
- legal sensitive (content was under an embargo)
- previous engineering, product, and design touch points all left late in the project
- no clarity of responsibility on key parts — i.e. who is pressing what buttons and when
