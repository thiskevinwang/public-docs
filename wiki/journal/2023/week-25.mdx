# Monday

It was a holiday. 

I sent this very fun indoor boulder problem https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtsMml9PS_Y/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

On Sunday, I also re-sent a local crimpy V9 for the fourth time. https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctrj5Z3vH4M/.
This was my 2nd time climbing outdoors since my ACL surgery and it felt absolutely
amazing to redo this problem.


# Tuesday

# Wednesday

I had physical therapy. Did some fun plyometric exercises, like single leg hops and box jumps.

I setup bi-weekly 1:1s with two adjacent-teammates, Zach and Kendall, to keep in closer touch
with them and look out for any platform-work opportunities or blind spots.

# Thursday

Had 1:1 with my manager Kaitlynne.

Converted this Wiki section of my site to no longer use a YAML file for navigation data,
and instead rely on a tree data structure, derived directly from the git tree and blob data.

`GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/trees/:tree_sha` returns a flat list of all the folders and files
in a repository, but no contents.

```bash
curl \
  --location 'https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/trees/manifestless?recursive=0'
```

The `sha` fields in the response can be used to fetch the contents, and in my case, the contents
contain YAML frontmatter which has human-friendly text like `title` which I can use to provide
a pretty label for navigation tree items.

`GET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/blobs/:file_sha` returns the contents of a file, base64 encoded, but
when you include `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw` as a header, the response is returned as plaintext â€” 
`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

```bash
curl \
  --location'https://api.github.com/repos/thiskevinwang/public-docs/git/blobs/6d71f922a0f925d26fdf6da99d19921cf6924baf' \
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw'
```


# Friday

I had physical therapy. Did some more strength oriented exercises.

Got some nice shoutouts from my teammates on recent build-time optimization work for our flagship apps:

- https://hashicorp.slack.com/archives/C02T80JTNS2/p1687462168989659- 
- https://hashicorp.slack.com/archives/C058H0MULTE/p1687468229404229

Removed legacy `getInitialProps` from `dev-portal`, in service of easier app router migration.

# Saturday

Came up with a nifty terminal AI zsh function:

```bash
function ask() {
  mods -f "$1" | glow
}
```

Did more work on my personal website.

Did some wiki writing.
