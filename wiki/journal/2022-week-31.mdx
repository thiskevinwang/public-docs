# Weekend

Over the past weekend, I built a fun little feature that I’m calling
_Regeneration History_. You can see it on the right side column (desktop width only).

I also watched a lot of [Big Timber] in the background, and worked on some
CloudWatch dashboards for Lambda function metrics.

See: [/wiki/cloud/aws/cloudwatch](/wiki/cloud/aws/cloudwatch)

## Regeneration History

I self-host & deploy my site on AWS so I can view some additional
bits of info that you forfeit when using a fully managed platform-as-a-service
like Netlify or Vercel.

I use [serverless-next.js] to build my site.
This package implements Next.js’ [ISR] by storing statically generated pages
in an S3 bucket. Anytime a page is re-generated, the S3 object
is modified, and if you have [versioning][s3-versioning] enabled, the object
will get a new version rather than being overwritten.

[serverless-next.js]: https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js
[isr]: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration
[s3-versioning]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html

For example, the S3 object for [/wiki/cloud/aws/s3](/wiki/cloud/aws/s3)
will be an `.html` file, located in the bucket at this particular path:

<Tree
  style={{
    '--geist-background': 'var(--accents-1)',
    marginLeft: 'var(--geist-gap)',
  }}
>
  <Folder name="{{BUCKET}}" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="static-pages/" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="GCj_xRxePC-Y5qCmHbcy9/" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="wiki/" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="cloud/" defaultOpen>
            <Folder name="aws/" defaultOpen>
              <File
                name="s3.html"
                style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'var(--geist-success)' }}
              />
            </Folder>
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Tree>

### S3 Object Versioning

Regular traffic to a page, which implies regular static regeneration, will result
in an object version dataset like so this...

| Version ID                                           | Type | Last modified                        | Size     | Storage class |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :--- | :----------------------------------- | :------- | :------------ |
| `_rI5.FdhyBN.RShARHk2LCLDTroKzelx` (Current version) | html | August 2, 2022, 17:23:09 (UTC-04:00) | 104.0 KB | Standard      |
| `u_fU1LwVH.hnq420YSRXcRgiUxyVA1NG`                   | html | August 2, 2022, 07:08:11 (UTC-04:00) | 104.0 KB | Standard      |
| `hauUtZRTY8t_B8MOiVR65tmYS1aHH3oM`                   | html | July 31, 2022, 15:56:05 (UTC-04:00)  | 104.0 KB | Standard      |
| `rVYRFxKN7HLx1uo2.KEf.hVv3zRsuifo`                   | html | July 31, 2022, 00:34:25 (UTC-04:00)  | 103.7 KB | Standard      |
| `IlKMyT27i7zGm9ozzxGdxF5Wjy_OlwAH`                   | html | July 30, 2022, 23:59:41 (UTC-04:00)  | 103.7 KB | Standard      |

### Usefulness

An _audit log_ or append-only-like log such is certainly useful in other
contexts, but I don’t think there is much value in this particular case of
a website’s static files.

For fun though, in case you wanted to build some sort a time-travel
feature (thinking about something similar to the [React.js tic-tac-toe time-travel feature][ttt]),
you could accomplish that this mechanism... but again, not
particularly useful.

## Terraform Core Versioned Docs

Today, I, along with my colleague Bryce, delivered _versioned docs_ for
the **Core** docs on [terraform.io](https://terraform.io/). This includes:

- https://www.terraform.io/intro
- https://www.terraform.io/cli
- https://www.terraform.io/language
- https://www.terraform.io/internals

While the trivial on the surface — you get a nifty little dropdown —
the underlying architecture is massively more complex. More on that
in a dedicated post maybe...

## Mermaid Rabbit Hole & GitHub GraphQL API Rate Limit

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Badge size="small" type="warning" variant="contrast">Poor choices</Badge>

After work, I went into one of the worst rabbit holes in recent
times.

**The Problem**: I had an initial implementation of `mermaid` diagrams
being rendered in MDX. However, these diagrams would render at build time
only, which takes place on my machine. Subsequent builds that would take
place on AWS Lambda in a _regeneration lambda_, during ISR would fail
with an difficult to diagnose error like:

> \_projectRoot is undefined. Unable to create a BrowserFetcher.

This lead me to use https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda.

However this ended up resulting in file trace issues that were caused
by some incompatibility with the `target: "serverless"` config that
`serverless-next.js` sets.

...The ugly part...

Throughout this process, I had built my site several times. My site
makes calls to the GitHub GraphQL API for data to statically render
pages — mostly the pages on this [`wiki`](/wiki) portion of the
site. I hadn’t yet optimized these calls, but I quickly realized that
I was exceeding the 5000 req/hr rate limit.

I continuously monitored my usage at https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer
and continued debugging two issues simultaneously — `mermaid`/`puppeteer`/`chromium`, and
excessive API calls to the GitHub API.

I needed to replace my troublesome code, which was already deployed on
AWS, with a new deployment **but** the static page generation during the
build process was blocked my GitHub API rate limit.

Both the deployed code and build attempts were simultaneously
exacerbating the rate limit.

_Oh lord..._

GitHub resets your rate limit every hour, so I stayed up throughout 3 of
these hour windows... from roughly 1:30AM to 4:30AM. In the first two
windows, I had failed to find/solve the culprit, and rate limit was reached
within minutes. I eventualy optimized and deleted some repeat API calls,
and delete other unecessary ones.

Here's one for fetching all the files in a tree shape. I deleted this.

```graphql
fragment treeEntryFields on TreeEntry {
  oid
  name
  type
}

query GetFileTree($owner: String!, $name: String!, $expression: String!) {
  rateLimit {
    cost
    remaining
    used
  }
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    name
    object(expression: $expression) {
      ... on Tree {
        entries {
          ...treeEntryFields
          name
          object {
            ... on Tree {
              entries {
                ...treeEntryFields
                name
                object {
                  ... on Tree {
                    entries {
                      ...treeEntryFields
                      name
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Logical Nullish Assignment `(??=)`

One takeaway and learning was this [logical nullish assigment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_nullish_assignment)
operator.

In this bare bones example, `fetch` only gets called once, despite the
wrapping `callApi` function being called three times.

```typescript filename="crude cache example"
let cache: Record<string, any> = {};

async function callApi(key) {
  cache[key] ??= await fetch(key);
}

await callApi('foo');
await callApi('foo');
await callApi('foo');
```

I eventually optimized a few repeat API calls, resolved my rate limit nightmare,
never ended up getting Mermaid diagrams to render on Lambda, and eventually
went to bed.

Awful life decision of staying up.

<Badge size="small">Dead</Badge>

I basically felt like garbage all day, and was hit by back to back Vercel gotchas
at work.

## Next.js && Nested Middleware incompatibility

```bash
# Error: Builder returned invalid routes: ["Route at index 25 has invalid `src` regular expression \"^(/_next/data/W1kPu1ISmrdZOGFG4eV3j)?((?:^/docs(?:(/.*)?)(\\.json)?$)$\"."]
```

From JJ Kasper:

> There should be a build error if nested middleware is used past 12.1.7-canary.9

## Nix Shell + Mermaid CLI

`mmdc` is the CLI command for the Mermaid CLI.

```bash
nix-shell -p nodePackages.mermaid-cli

# [nix-shell:~/repos/public-docs]

cat <<EOF | mmdc -o test.svg
graph LR
    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    C-->F
EOF
```
