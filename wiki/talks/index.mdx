## What I learned

(...or reinforced)

- A little bit of OBS
- Don’t overthink the technical setup
- Ensure you understand what you’re talking about
- Establish the scope clearly
- 11 minutes is very short
- Probably just use `loom` or something convenient app that provides portrait-in-picture
- Try not to fuss with multi-clip videos
- Recording a video is a bit of an artistic endeavor. Make sure you have a quiet environment
  that you can focus in.
